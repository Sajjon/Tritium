# Tritium
Tritium - H3 - is an open source frontend (GUI) for Heroes of Might and Magic III in pure Swift, powered by the Swift HoMM3 game engine [`Makt`](https://github.com/Sajjon/Makt)

I've just managed to render maps, using original game resources that `Makt` extracts. But performance is terrible, since I've literally put zero effort into this. So next is to come up with a good solution. Maybe generate a PNG image for the whole map and use a **single** [SwiftUI `Image` View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/image) (instead of tens of thousands).
